" MultipleSearch allows you to have the results of multiple searches displayed
" on the screen at the same time.  Each search highlights its results in a
" different color, and all searches are displayed at once.  After the maximum
" number of colors is used, the script starts over with the first color.
" 
" The command syntax is: 
" :Search <pattern1> 
" which will highlight all occurrences of <pattern1> in the current buffer.  A
" subsequent :Search <pattern2> will highlight all occurrences of <pattern2>
" in the current buffer, retaining the highlighting of <pattern1> as well.
" <pattern1> and <pattern2> are any search pattern like you would use in a
" normal /<pattern> search.
"
" The :Search command honors Vim's 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' settings for
" its own search.  You can use the \c and \C flags in the search pattern to
" force case matching no matter the setting of 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'.
"
" The :SearchBuffers command works just like :Search, but the search occurs in
" all currently listed buffers (i.e., those that appear in the output of :ls).
" The match in all buffers will have the same color.  This is different than 
" :bufdo Search <pattern> because in that case, each buffer will highlight the
" match in a different color.
" 
" To clear the highlighting, issue the command :SearchReset (for the current
" buffer) or :SearchBuffersReset (for all buffers).
" 
" You can specify the maximum number of different colors to use by setting the
" g:MultipleSearchMaxColors variable in your .vimrc.  The default setting is
" four, but the script should handle as much as your terminal / GUI can
" display.  The g:MultipleSearchColorSequence variable lets you list the
" colors you want displayed, and in what order.  To make the text more
" readable, you can set the g:MultipleSearchTextColorSequence variable to a
" list of colors for the text, each position corresponding to the color in the
" same position in g:MultipleSearchColorSequence.

" If you change one of the preference variables, you can issue the command
" :SearchReinit
" to update the script with your new selections.
